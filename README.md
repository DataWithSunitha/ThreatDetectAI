# ThreatDetectAI â€“ Cybersecurity Anomaly Detection

## ðŸ“Š Overview
ThreatDetectAI identifies unusual network activity and user behavior anomalies using machine learning.  
The project helps security teams detect threats early and visualize anomalies for actionable insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem
Organizations face increasing cyber threats. Proactive detection of anomalies reduces response times and prevents financial and reputational loss.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
- Detected abnormal login and network activity patterns  
- Visualized anomalies and severity scores to prioritize investigations  
- Demonstrated model tracking using MLflow to compare performance across experiments  

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Python | PyTorch | PySpark | MLflow | Pandas | Matplotlib

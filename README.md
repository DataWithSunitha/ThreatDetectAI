## Features

- Simulated cybersecurity log dataset including login attempts, failed logins, session duration, and data transferred.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and correlation heatmaps.
- Anomaly detection using **Isolation Forest** to flag suspicious activity.
- Visualizations highlighting anomalies.
- Saves processed results for further analysis.
